Kazsid is a pure Debian live system, targeted on Kazakh users.

It was based on Debian sid branch, but switched to testing.

To build it, you should have Debian wheezy box (recommended), and
live-build package installed.

At first, run the download-packages.sh script to get some
packages to install. We are using them because those packages
are not in the official Debian repos.

While building an image, you will have to accept some
licences. Because of that, dialog frontend for dpkg
was chosen. Don't know how to automate that.

By the way, to reduce the final image size,
all locales except kk,ru,en are removed with localepurge.

Usually I build it with
"time sudo lb build 2>&1 | tee build.log" command
