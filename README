Kazsid is a pure Debian live system, targeted on Kazakh users.
Its purpose is to provide a full-featured desktop Linux
entirely on Kazakh language.

It is based on Debian sid.

To build it, you should have Debian wheezy/sid box, and
live-build package (>3.0) installed.

At first, run the download-packages.sh script to get some
packages to install. We are using them because these packages
are not in the official Debian repos.

There are some firmware packages and Sun's Java 6, which
have their own licences. These licences are autoaccepted
during build. Take a look at
config/chroot_local-preseed directory.

By the way, to reduce the final image size,
all locales except kk,ru,en are removed with localepurge.

Usually I build it with
"time sudo lb build 2>&1 | tee build.log" command
