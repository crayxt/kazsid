Kazsid is a pure Debian live system, targeted on Kazakh users.

It was based on Debian sid branch, but switched to testing.

To build it, you should have Debian wheezy box (recommended), and
live-build package installed.

At first, run the download-packages.sh script to get some
packages to install. We are using them because those packages
are not in the official Debian repos.

Usually I build it with
"time sudo lb build 2>&1 | tee build.log" command
