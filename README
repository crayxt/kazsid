Kazsid is a pure Debian live system, targeted on Kazakh users.
Its purpose is to provide a full-featured desktop Linux
entirely on Kazakh language.

It was based on Debian sid branch, but switched to testing.
We couldn't find a replace to its name, so we decided to
leave the old name.

To build it, you should have Debian wheezy box (recommended), and
live-build package installed.

At first, run the download-packages.sh script to get some
packages to install. We are using them because those packages
are not in the official Debian repos.

There are some firmware packages and Sun's Java 6, which
have their own licences. Those licences are autoaccepted
during build. Take a look at
config/chroot_local-preseed directory.

By the way, to reduce the final image size,
all locales except kk,ru,en are removed with localepurge.

Usually I build it with
"time sudo lb build 2>&1 | tee build.log" command
